Collection of projects exploring low level computing and the world of compilers.

## Why?
In my current school we have a subject dedicated to learning about low level computers (Logic gates, wiring, ALUs, CPUs)
Because I already know some basics, I decided to create my own assembly language (and assembler) to learn more about
higher (but still low) level computers, how assemblers work and possibly how higher level compilers (LLVM) works.
